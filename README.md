# Ai-Osu-bot---kimi
A Python-based rhythm engine that recreates osu!-style hitobjects (circles, sliders, long notes) and uses “Kimi,” an AI player that reads objects, predicts timing, and follows slider paths using Bezier/Catmull curves. Supports both JSON beatmaps. Designed for learning, experimentation, and AI development—NOT for cheating.
